# Optical-Modulation-of-CsPbBr-Nanoplatelets-
I perform a comparative analysis of photoluminescence spectra sourced from open-access repository (Mendeley Database) to assess how ligand chain length, concentration and halide exchange affect CsPbBr₃ nanoplatelet emission and bandgap.

Accepted work at 2nd International Conference on Frontiers in Science: Innovation & Technology for Greener Industry 
(2nd ICFS:ITGI) Organized by: Faculty of Science, BUET.
